## For devices with the A8 SOC that support iOS 16+, it is a different process to get cryptex1 blobs as x8A4 is not compatible.
---
For those devices, I created a Python script to extract that value, but the issue is that the device must be running iOS 16 or higher for it to work.
just run `python3 A8.py`, answer the questions, and the cnch value will be your cryptex1 nonce, the cryptex1 seed is not obtainable with this method so unfortunately you will have to use '0x11111111111111111111111111111111' you can continue to [this section with the given value](https://github.com/techspice0/get-blobs-py#values-to-save)
